      <p class="paragraph-width--large">Just how did a girl from the suburbs of Chicago and a boy from the cornfields of Iowa find each other? It didn't take much effort, really. It just took one rainy day, several college campus visits and the Old Capital at the University of Iowa to put them in the same state. Read the story of how they met and fell in love in their own words.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-width--large">As a boy growing up in Iowa I knew of only one school I would attend upon high school graduation. It's the only school worth attending in Iowa - no I'm not joking friends from Iowa State. In fact, I wanted to go so bad I didn't even apply to another school and my mom had to drag me to an on-campus visit to confirm what I had already explained to her.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-width--large">During my fall semester of freshman year I didn't have much time to meet new people. Between school work and rowing crew, I had very little time for any extra activities. Alright, I may have attended a few socials with the sororties and even attended one that Kesley was at - we didn't meet here however. But really, I didn't have anymore extra time.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-width--large">It wasn't until the spring of that year that I met Kesley for the first time. I remember seeing her in my dorm room hallway one random night and thought, "She's <i>pretty</i> good looking". I asked a mutual friend who she was and what I needed to know about her. One fact stood out. She liked the band <a href="spotify:artist:42aeGx2I3uXINpGqC8L0LD" target="_blank">Jack's Mannequin</a>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-width--large">It just so happened that spring an on-campus organization, 10,000 Hours, was sponsoring a free concert for students who completed 10 hours of community service. The featured band: Jack's Mannequin. It didn't take much effort to convince Kesley to volunteer with me.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-width--large">I'm not sure what it was about those 10 hours of communinty service, but some how that kicked started our amazing 10 year relationship. I'm truly lucky to have found Kesley and can't be more excited to marry her.</p>
